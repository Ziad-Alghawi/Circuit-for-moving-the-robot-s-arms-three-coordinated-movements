# Circuit-for-moving-the-robot-s-arms-three-coordinated-movements

First, I used the Tinkercad website.

Second, I used the required elements, which are as follows:

The Breadboard small

Arduino UNO R3

Six Micro servo Motors 

Then I connected the circuit as shown in the picture.

In the beginning I reached the Ground and the Power

Then I connected the servo motors with the Arduino 

additionally I wrote code for three diffirent movement 

first movement for the angel from 180 degree to 0 degree

Second movement for the angel from 90 degree to 0 degree

Third movement for the angel from 60 degree to 0 degree
